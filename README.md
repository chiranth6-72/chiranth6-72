## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **full stack software engineer** who enjoys building **reliable backend systems**
and **well-structured frontend applications**.

I primarily work with **Go 🦫, Python 🐍, Node.js 🟢, PostgreSQL 🐘, and React ⚛️**.
I like designing APIs, working with concurrency, optimizing performance, and writing
code that is easy to test and maintain.

Most of my projects focus on **backend engineering ⚙️**, **distributed systems 🌐**,
and **scalable application design 📈**.
